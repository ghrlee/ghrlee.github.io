                      <p>After taking the first job in Chicago that hired me and seemed pretty decent, I quickly became pretty tied down to a job at a relatively small start up. Over the next few years of working there I relearned the value of my independence. Before when I had it, I didn't know what to do with it. My independence went away with a dead end job :(</p>
