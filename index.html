            I have always held a strong passion to make connections between teams, disciplines and technologies.

            I am most interested in finding the intersections between technology, civic life, language, and the people touched by these pathways. From Latin America, to Washington, DC to Chicago, I appreciate the story my experiences have helped me to write so far and that I continue to build with joy, laughter and while bringing out the best in my colleagues.
