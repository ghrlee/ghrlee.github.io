      I can't help but say I'm pretty pumped about how much I learned in a week with git. Here I am just a few days in and I'm building websites from the windows terminal without looking up commands or second guessing myself. It wasn't that hard either.

        Version control is largely a new concept to me but I think we see its use in more than just git. I have a friend who is an enterprising fellow from England who built a business around having ESL university students send him their college essays about any topic and he would simply edit them to give them an authentic English speaker's voice. Easy work for him and he would merely make a few edits here and there. He was even pretty popular among graduate students and professors.

      <p>This is pretty much the idea behind version control. A collaborative effort being done remotely. 
        If the student didn't like the effort, they could go back to the original file. Save work to git by committing and you've got a save point. Use log and you can see all the previous commits.

        Git seems pretty ideal. Instead of keep all my work locally, it can be made available on Github to be viewed by others. In case I get stuck, it's available for others to view for when I assuredly ask for all the help I can get. It's also pretty quick to learn!
