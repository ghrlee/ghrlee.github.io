      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
      I find myself thinking a lot about how I look at my own indepence in the last few years. I moved to chicago around five years ago as big step towards
      indepence. Independence for myself, I had very few ties keeping me in the city I was in. I valued opportunity I had to take my life anywhere and I 
      was floating on the wind a bit. After taking the first job in Chicago that hired me and seemed pretty decent, I quickly became pretty tied down to
      a job at a relatively small start up. Over the next few years of working there I relearned the value of my independence. Before when I had it, I didn't
      know what to do with it. My independence went away with a dead end job :(
    </p>

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
       The last time someone asked me for advice that comes to mind, it was of a romantic nature. Great romantic relationships foster independence. I look back
       on my relationships in the past and I have always felt supported in my personal decisions. A lack of independence can really put a wet blanket on
       a relationship. I think we all know this but when you're in a relationship it can be hard to see these things for yourself. As I said, independence has
       been a huge theme for me in the past few years, and in my last relationship as in my last job, there was a severe lack of it.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> 
        I feel very optimistic and I look forward towards the future when I think about my independence. I don't think that in the future I will suffer from 
        a lack of independence as I have. This has been hard won ground. It took a long time to recognize that independence was something that I actually
        value, let alone something I need back in my life. I rearranged my life to reflect my new values. I parted ways with my last relationship and with 
        the job I mentioned. I looked at the job market and it looked to me that web development would be the most accessible while hopefully providing a 
        much higher degree of independence. As a good web developer, I'm likely to find a job in most cities around the US, and maybe even abroad. Or I 
        could use my skills working at home, taking care of my dog and being a good dad to him :)
