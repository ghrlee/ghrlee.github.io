    To me, this is an ideal time in my life to take on DBC. I think I know how to learn and how to concentrate at this point in my life. In my first couple years at my university, I was a computer science major. But I thought I couldn't hack it, and I convinced myself that even if I could find a job after graduating, that I would totally suck at it. I wound up doing Political Science and doing pretty well out of school. I don't think I would really change anything about that path, but I do think I would tell my university self that there was no reason to think that I wouldn't pass my heavier CS classes.

    But this is something that I've learned about myself after years of experience. Some time in school I learned about breath meditation after getting the hick-ups for a few days in a row. I tried everything and one of my friends in the building I was in basically did a guided meditation with me. It did the trick and since then I've come back to meditation. In the last two years especially meditation has taught me a lot about myself and my general approach to life. I know enough about my style of concentration to know that DBC is right up my alley.

        That's about it! Thanks!
