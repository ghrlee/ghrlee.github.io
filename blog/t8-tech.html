      third party libraries: ruby gems
      Rails is a framework for building web applications with the programming language Ruby. It's like building a house with the frame already up and you just have to put together what makes it a home. The paint, the pictures on the wall, the people inside are put together by the the developer. Rails empowers developers to create meaningful web applications very rapidly by providing and making use of this framework.

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
       Rails was created in 2004 by David Heinemeier Hansson and he based Rails on the Ruby language based on the MVC design pattern which I am still learning about (tbc). It emphasizes using DRY code and being efficient code that is very quick and easy to write. So you wind up getting a power web app in just a day even. In addition to the out of the box scaffolding for webapplications that Rails provides, there is also the additional tools of Ruby Gems; libraries made by other users great for personalizing and creating web apps.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> 
        This all makes me pretty excited. I remember being interested in web development as a teenager in the late 90's and early 2000's and being put off by how seemingly complicated it was. I think that if RoR was around at the time, I would not have shyed away so easily!
