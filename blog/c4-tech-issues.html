      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->For this blog entry I took a look at the google search results for "Tech Industry Problem". The first and most frequent results dealt with sexism within the industry and the second most frequently returned results dealth with diversity. If I had to guess without doing any research, I would have easily, easily guessed that these were the two biggest problems confronting the industry at the moment. To be fair though, in the United States these two problems persist in most industries. However, most articles take the position that these two problems are especially pronounced in tech.

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->My take. Here's my take because it might be interesting to you. First of all, I think the problem starts with a pipeline issue. I started at the University of Arizona in 2002 as a computer science major. And to look back on the experience, it was a very bizarre environment. While I tried to be friendly and sociable on all levels, being a Mexican-American trying to learn programming, I had no one to relate to in my class on that level. It's not that computers and technology were not interesting to Mexican-Americans as I saw it, most of my friends being Mexican Americans and very interested in technology. There were women in my class and they all seemed to be dating the TA's. I kind of think that pattern gets reflected when we hear about sexism in office settings in the industry. One thing worth noting though was the department head was a women.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> Will these problems go away? I don't know because it seems very institutional to me. Even in my cohort at DBC, there are two women out of about 20 or so students. The San Francisco cohort seems a bit more balanced. I currently work at a Chicago tech startup. In my department, I think it's a little more reflective of reality. There as many men and women present and I'm not the only Mexican in the room. However, I'm not in the tech department. I'm in the lowly, sad, underpaid operations department. If we look at the tech department, once again, mostly men and mostly white. So I do think there is a potential for a change. The tech industry just has to open the door.
