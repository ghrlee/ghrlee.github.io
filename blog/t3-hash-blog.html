      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->This week we are learning about the magical mystery of Array vs. Hashes. When should you use one and when should use the other? Will this eternal struggle never end? Let's see how the fight turns out. Taking all bets. 
    </p>

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->First what is an array? This isn't too hard to answer. An array is a list, pretty simple but it has a few qualities. The list is numbered and ordered, and each number in sequence points to a value. There are many ways to declare a string, but one easey way is the literal way like this: </p> <p> ary = [1, "two", 3.0] #=> [1, "two", 3.0] </p>
       <p> Things start to get interesting when we do things like having the values actually just be other arrays. Making them 2 dimensional arrays. You can then make those arrays hold arrays. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> Hash tables are like arrays, but they don't have an order. They're kind of just jumbled up. You can find a variable by a linked key. These keys have to be unique but the values can repeat.
