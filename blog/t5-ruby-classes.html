      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
      My attempt at explaining classes will hopefully be pretty fun because I think of this as a chance to get nerdy. Dungeons and dragons nerdy. In Dungeons and Dragons, we have the classic example of character classes. Think of the Dungeons and Dragons archetype classes: The Rogue, the Wizard, the Rastamon... and so on. Rastamon was in lord of the rings movie right? Anyway, what I'm going to attempt to explain is that any thing with an attribute or two, especially a quantifiable class, is a great opportunity for creating a class. 
    </p>
    <p>
       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
       If we start to think about just the types of characters we listed above, we can see how their attributes set them apart. Our rogue is cunning, swift, good with a dagger, and probably has charm to spare. The wizard: wise, powerful, and oooooold. Rastamon? I forget what that guy does, all I know is we have a great time whenever he's around
       
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> 
        What if started to set that up like this:
        <table>
   <tr>
      <p>
     Class: The Rogue
         Name: Roger Black
         Stealth: 40 points
         Dagger: 100 points
         Charm: 500 points
       </p>
  

    
      <p>
         Class: The Wizard
         Age: 521 years
         Wisdom: 130 points
         Magic: 200 poins
      </p>
      <p>
        Class: The Rastamon
        Dreads: 421 dreads
        Dub: 10 points (maximum reverb)
        Spliff bonus: 50 points
      </p>

      <p>
        I don't know about you guys, but I always played as the rastamon, he had the best character sheets.

      <p> If we were to set the wizard up as a class in ruby, it may look something like this: </p>

      <p> We can see that we are starting to set up variables in the place of qualities for this class. These are instance variables that we will be able to use and manipulate whenever we call an instance of the class. For example, one way to do this is through a method particular to the class. I initiated one "fire_blast" What does this do? Well hopefully it will take a roll from a di and multiply it but whatever @power is at the moment. </p>
