      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->I'm pretty ashamed to say that while using CSS, I was pretty careless using element selectors to make pretty changes to my personal site and just hoping it stuck. Not know that I didn't have to make changes to all "p" elements or all "h3" elements, etc. There's a new way for me to make CSS changes only to the exact objects that I need, and that is using classes and ids.
    </p>

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->My head is still swimming, but while I let it settle down, ids and classes kind of go and search the html for certain indicators and tell css where to act. With an ID we can say to the CSS, go and act on the third paragraph down specifically, but not anything else. You're only going to use it once, but you can have the CSS enact several changes on anything ID hits.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->With a class however, the idea is that it will be in use multiple times throughout the site. Maybe not even just the one page, you're entire site. Any time you need to make the same styling change to multiple objects, you'll be using a class. Call it anything you want and make it do anything you want. I created the class "transbox" on this page to create a box around this text you're ready. So it works :)
