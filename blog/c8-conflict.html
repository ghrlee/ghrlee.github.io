      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
       I'm lucky because I grew up with two lovely little sisters. Conflict definitely came up though, and since we're all adults we are all open to talking about things back then. I think I was pretty emotionally unintelligent as a young kid, but that somehow led to a pretty emotionally fulfilled and emotionally mature adult life. Not sure how that came to be, but I do know it has a lot to do with my family life then.

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
       So speaking of sisters, and speaking of computers one conflict came up when my sister asked to use my computer while I was in college. She was still in high school and didn't quite have one of her own at the time. If I remember correctly, she had been using it for an extraordinarily long amount of time. Unreasonable! But since this is hind-sight, it was probably like 10 minutes. I had just changed majors to Political Science and was openly discussing going into to law school at the time time. After some arguing about the computer, I remember she had said to me "god you'll wind up being a shitty lawyer". I was pissed and then immediately started laughing because, well it was just a good joke at the time. Some times our fights were heated but we often tempered the fights with humor. We often fondly remember cooling off with laughter.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> 
        Humor was never used to change the subject during a fight. I think that's important. But making light of a situation when tastefully done can sometimes be pleasant exit.
