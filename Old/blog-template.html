      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
      I think a good question can be many things. A good question can be well researched. Have you looked into other folks out there finding a similar problem? Most likely someone else has run into the same problem. Can you imagine a possible work around? This might be a solution to save for the end, but if you can think of another way on the fly, put it together and save the original promblem for later. Who are you posing your question to, a colleague, a teacher or the general developer community? In my experience, a question posed to a teacher or a colleague can be curt and to the point since often it's the case they already know what you are talking about and don't need a lengthy explanation. This won't be the case if you're posing a question online.

       <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
       A good question knows that it is looking for a helpful answer. I think something happens when you voice a question that makes the answer more forthcoming. The person posing the question actually has to understand the question before putting it out to the world and in this way has to understand the underlying problem. If we didn't understand the problem in the first place, we are half way to answering the question ourselves by giving the question life.

        <!-- Paragraph 3 --> 
        Can the question be tailored? We have uttered and it is out there and written. Can we imagine answering the same question posed to ourselves. When we read it back, is the question readily understood? Spend some time away, come back, reinterpret the question if the need calls for it.
